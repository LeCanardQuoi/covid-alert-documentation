# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy for COVID Alert

_Canadian Digital Service & Office of the Chief Information Officer_ \
_Date: 2020-07-31_

The Government of Canada is committed to protecting people’s information. COVID Alert has been built in the open so everyone can see the code base. We value the time and effort of security researchers and anyone else who may want to contribute. However, we do not offer monetary rewards for vulnerability disclosures.

This policy gives security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and submitting discovered vulnerabilities to us. It covers:

*   **What systems and types of research** are covered under this policy. 
*   **How to send us** vulnerability reports. 
*   **How long** we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.

We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they’ve discovered so we can fix them and keep our users safe. 

## Scope 	

This policy applies to the following systems and services:

*   [https://retrieval.covid-notification.alpha.canada.ca/](https://retrieval.covid-notification.alpha.canada.ca/services/version.json)
*   [https://submission.covid-notification.alpha.canada.ca/](https://submission.covid-notification.alpha.canada.ca/services/version.json)
*   Source code at 
    *   [https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server) 
    *   [https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app)
    *   [https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-portal](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-portal) 

**Any service not expressly listed above, such as any connected services, are excluded from scope** and are not authorized for testing. Additionally, vulnerabilities found in non-Government of Canada systems  fall outside of this policy’s scope and should be reported directly to them according to their disclosure policy (if any). If you aren’t sure whether a system or endpoint is in scope or not, contact us at [security@cds-snc.ca](mailto:security@cds-snc.ca) before starting your research.

Though we develop and maintain other Internet-accessible systems or services, please keep your _active research and testing_ to the systems and services covered by this scope. If there is a particular system not in scope that you think merits testing, please contact us to discuss it first. 

## Looking for vulnerabilities

**Do not conduct the following types of tests:**

*   Denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests (e.g. overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests)
*   Physical testing (e.g. office access, open doors, tailgating)
*   Social engineering (e.g. phishing)
*   Any other non-technical vulnerability testing including using high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities.

**When looking for vulnerabilities:**

*   Always comply with data protection rules and do not break any applicable laws or regulations. Do not violate the privacy of the Government of Canada’s (GC) users, staff, contractors, services or systems. Do not, for example, share, redistribute, modify, or fail to properly secure data retrieved from the systems or services.
*   Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to “pivot” or disrupt other systems or services.
*   Once you’ve established that a vulnerability exists or encounter any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information, or proprietary information or trade secrets of any party), **you must stop your test, notify us immediately, and not disclose this data to anyone else**.
*   Securely delete all data retrieved during your research as soon as it is no longer required or within 1 month of the vulnerability being resolved, whichever occurs first (or as otherwise required by data protection law).

## Submitting a vulnerability you’ve found

Information you submit under this policy is only used to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue. Please submit your report to us **by email at [security@cds-snc.ca](mailto:security@cds-snc.ca)**. You can submit reports anonymously. We do not support PGP-encrypted emails at this time. 

### What we would like to see from you

**In your report:**

*   Write in English or French.
*   Describe the vulnerability, where it was discovered, and the potential impact of exploitation. 
*   Offer a detailed description of the steps to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept scripts or screenshots are helpful). These should be benign, non-destructive, proofs of concept so we can triage your report quickly and accurately. 
*   Do not submit reports detailing non-exploitable vulnerabilities, or reports indicating that the services do not fully align with “best practice”, for example missing security headers, or a high volume of low-quality reports (for example, from an automated scanner).
*   Do not communicate any vulnerabilities or associated details other than by means described in the published security.md file.
*   Do not demand financial compensation to disclose any vulnerabilities.

### What to expect 

When you choose to share your contact information with us, we commit to coordinating with you as openly and as quickly as possible.

*   Within 3 business days, we will acknowledge that your report has been received. 
*   To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the vulnerability to you and be as transparent as possible about what steps we are taking during the remediation process, including on issues or challenges that may delay resolution. 
*   We will prioritize fixing the vulnerability by looking at the impact, severity and exploit complexity. Vulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address. You’re welcome to ask the status but please no more than once every 14 days. That way, our teams can focus on the remediation.
*   We will maintain an open dialogue with you to discuss issues and will work with you to determine whether and how the flaw reported will be made public.
*   We will treat your report in accordance with the _Access to Information Act_ and _Privacy Act_. We will not share your personal details with third parties without your permission.
*   We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately.

## Authorization 

If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized, we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and the Government of Canada will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research.

In the event of any law enforcement or civil action brought by anyone other than the GC, the GC will take steps to make known that your activities were conducted pursuant to and in compliance with this policy.

## Legalities 

You are solely responsible for your own compliance with law. This policy does not give you permission to act in any illegal manner and does not protect you if you break the law. However, if a third party begins legal action against you and you have complied with this policy, we can make it known that you acted in compliance with this policy.
